# Pennsylvania Dutch Cooking

This is a MarkDown version of the Pennsylvania Dutch Cooking that can be found here: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26558

## Why are you doing this?

I wanted to send my wife just 1 recipe.  However the original document is one long.  It would be easier to send her a link to just one MarkDown file.

## Why are you putting recipes in seperate files?

Easier to read and search by

## Why are all commits going to the master branch?

This not a bunch of technical that will need branched its just copy and pasting recipes.

## Will this be submitted back to Project Gutenberg?

Of course. I just want to get this coverted.

## why aren't you numbering the recipe like the introductions?

Two reasons:

1. There is no index there isn't much of reason
2. I figured the recipe title is more important

## Will you standardize the naming of the to something like Camel Case?

That ia the plan.  Right now I'm just using the recipes title as is.  When I go through and do my first round of clean up that will be my first target/
